1.11 - Mon Jan  3 16:47:10 2005
	* Previously, this module refused to work unless the input array had
	more than one element.  What's the point of cycling otherwise?  I've
	removed that restriction, though, because I shouldn't be the one who
	gets to decide that.  A one element array should get a chance to act
	like any other array.  It just happens to have one element.
